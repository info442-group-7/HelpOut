# Homework 2: Design Specification

## Problem Space
The unprecedented spread of the coronavirus has changed all lifestyles. To ‘flatten the curve’ of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative that our society practices ‘social distancing’ - a practice requiring minimal contact with others. However, these required measures can separate communities and create barriers for those needing help the most during these times. People that need help may be facing new challenges as a result of this crisis, and their access to essential supplies may have changed as a result. Taking a trip to the grocery store may now be life-threatening for an immunocompromised individual, and a person’s new caregiving responsibilities may now limit both their financial autonomy and their ability to leave their house.
 
On the other hand, because of the unprecedented nature of this crisis, individuals that are willing to help those in need are often unsure of what they can do to make a difference. Opportunities to volunteer remotely are limited and often difficult to find, but the free time of many has increased as they stay at home. As a result, willing community volunteers are left feeling incapable of making a difference, and those in need are left feeling helpless. This illustrates the serious barriers that communities are facing to support one another in times when community support may be most important. 

## Our Proposed Solution
During such a crisis, it is imperative to bridge the gap between those who are in need of help and those who are willing to offer it. By appealing to the altruism of people in our community, we can create means of attaining necessary resources. Our solution, HelpOut, is a resource portal that allows anyone seeking help to request it, matching those requests to volunteers living in the same area who can fulfill them. With our web application, we hope to show that being apart does not mean a community cannot feel together. 

Our solution will have two core user groups - those volunteering to help and those seeking help. For those wanting to volunteer, we aim for this solution to be both intrinsically and extrinsically motivating for volunteers. Volunteers will feel intrinsically motivated to help for the good of the community, with daily community totals portrayed that will help remind the user of the good they are doing. However, we also feel that extrinsic rewards are important for many users, and have included incentivizing, point-based aspects to request fulfillment. Different requests are worth different amounts of stars, allocated to each request based on the date posted and urgency. Users can collect these stars, and will be given visible titles prefacing their names based on how many they have gained (i.e. ‘Community Hero’, ‘The Best Neighbor’). 

For those seeking help, we want this application to give them support with low-barriers to entry and a highly usable and accessible experience. The request-based interfaces are conversational and non-intimidating as a result, and the app overall has been simplified to have two navigation portals: one for each user that are easy to navigate to on the landing page. 

We have made it a point to use a simplistic design approach to accommodate for elderly users who might not be as technologically-savvy. We aim to have this portal as a go-to resource for members of the community during this crisis, appealing to the fundamental kindness and humanitarianism to uplift each other and stay connected as a community.
