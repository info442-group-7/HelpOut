# HelpOut

## Our Mission

Providing resources for communities to stay connected and uplifted through the COVID-19 crisis. 

### Problem Definition

The unprecedented spread of the coronavirus changed all lifestyles. To ‘flatten the curve’ of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative that our society practices ‘social distancing’ - a practice requiring minimal contact with others. However, these required measures can separate communities and create barriers for those needing help the most during these times. The stressors emerging from this pandemic are numerous: including the fear of infection, financial loss/unemployment and inadequate access to supplies and information. This, coupled with the fact that 34% of quarantined individuals report high levels of “psychological distress”, means that community support is increasingly important. Additionally, adults older than 65 are most at risk of contracting the virus, yet 34% of this age group live alone. As a result, elderly individuals will also be disproportionately affected by loneliness associated with quarantining: particularly those living alone that rely on social contact in community spaces, such as community centers and places of worship. The most vulnerable populations are being separated from those most able to help, and due to the unprecedented nature of COVID-19, previous ways to address isolation are failing to address the issues at a high level. In a time where even the simplest of tasks, such as going to a grocery store, places strain on members of our community, the ability to connect with one another, while still social distancing, is needed.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
