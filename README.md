# HelpOut

## Our Mission

Providing resources for communities to stay connected and uplifted through the COVID-19 crisis. 

### Problem Definition

The unprecedented spread of the coronavirus changed all lifestyles. To ‘flatten the curve’ of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative that our society practices ‘social distancing’ - a practice requiring minimal contact with others. However, these required measures can separate communities and create barriers for those needing help the most during these times. The stressors emerging from this pandemic are numerous: including the fear of infection, financial loss/unemployment and inadequate access to supplies and information. This, coupled with the fact that 34% of quarantined individuals report high levels of “psychological distress”, means that community support is increasingly important. Additionally, adults older than 65 are most at risk of contracting the virus, yet 34% of this age group live alone. As a result, elderly individuals will also be disproportionately affected by loneliness associated with quarantining: particularly those living alone that rely on social contact in community spaces, such as community centers and places of worship. The most vulnerable populations are being separated from those most able to help, and due to the unprecedented nature of COVID-19, previous ways to address isolation are failing to address the issues at a high level. In a time where even the simplest of tasks, such as going to a grocery store, places strain on members of our community, the ability to connect with one another, while still social distancing, is needed.
